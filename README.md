# Predicting Time Spent in Displacement for Iraqis (2014-2020)

## Introduction

Displacement of populations during a military crisis is of major interest to humanitarian, military, and diplomatic organizations, particularly if this displacement is protracted. The ability to forecast the **length of time that households spend in displacement** (before returning to their place of origin) is useful as it allows organizations to better allocate scarce resources and organize logitics to support and protect displaced peoples. This project takes a machine learning approach to predicting the 'length of time spent in displacement' for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). 

## Data sources

### Data on IDP outflows
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has [extensive data tracking Iraqi IDP movements](http://iraqdtm.iom.int/). Specifically, this project used data on outgoing population flows that divided movements into different temporal displacement waves connected to military or political upheaval, i.e., "June 2016". Each row represented the location of origin for households, the distribution of households by current location at the Governorate level (roughly analagous to US State), distribution of households by shelter type, and date.
